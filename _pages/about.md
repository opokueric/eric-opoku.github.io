Welcome! I am a PhD Health Economics candidate in the University of Toronto's Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation in the Dalla Lana School of Public Health. [You can download my CV here](http://opokueric/eric-opoku.github.io/files/CV_Eric_Opoku_Research.pdf).

My primary field is health economics, microeconomics, macroeconomics and applied econometrics. My thesis focuses on the maternal health and socioeconomic outcomes following preterm birth. Details about my publications, working papers, grants, and teaching experience are available on this site.
